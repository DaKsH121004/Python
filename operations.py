print(6+7)
print(6-4)
print(6*7)
print(5/2)#  / will give decimal value 
print(5//2)# // not give decimal value 
print(5%2) # modolous , reminder  
print(5**2) # ** denotes power operator give 5 power 2 = 25 


## shortcuts in python 
i = 5
i = i + 2   # we write this expresssion in this format also i+=2
i -= 2# for minus 
i *= 2# for mul


### operators precidence (check precidence table )
result = 2 + 3 / 5
print (result)
#### COMPARISION OPERATORS 
print(3>2)#greater than 
print(3<2)#less than
print(3>=2)#greater than equal to 
print(3<=2)#less  than equal to 
print(3==3)#equal to equal to 
print(3!=3)#not equal to 

##### LOGICAL OPERATORS 
print(2>3 or 2>1) # if atleast one condition is true it means it print true if both conditions are false it prints false (OR OPERATOR )
print(3>2 and 2>1)# if both conditions are true then it prints true otherwiswe it prints false 
print( not 3>2)# it converts true condition into false and vice versa
